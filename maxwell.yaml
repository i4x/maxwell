    more experienced bakers spoke I would like to make a suggestion that somehow seems
    to make sense. Would hanging upside down for a period each day help? Fluid and
    gunk that has collected in the lungs would then be coaxed downhill and out the
    door. Granted this would not be a cure-all but may improve lung function, O2 levels
    and overall comfort. A pair of gravity booties and a modified Kevlar Massage Vest
    (link) might do the trick. You could claim that you'd always wanted to beat gravity
    and become an inch taller, and whatever accumulation that is coughed up is merely
    a by-product.

- content: As to palliative care that won't fog your brain, phenibut, a GABA activator,
    is sometimes on ebay and immediately available online. It is a Nootropic that
    does make me think of more/better ideas and makes people relaxed and sociable.
    It also is a mild anaesthetic, and I always feel healthier when I am on it. As
    a data point, if I have a rash or scratch these goe from red back to white when
    I take phenibut. 2 grams is the usual dose but I am sure you have plans in moderation
    for your kidneys. The main point is it is a nootropic that makes you feel better
    and is a mild body anesthetic. Wikipedia says one dose lasts about 24 hours. It
    also makes falling asleep easier and the sleep more restful. It has downsides,
    It might reregulate your GABA receptors towards less enjoyable if you use it more
    than two times a week, and you shouldn't drive on it.

    which is the commonest type. However, it's behaving "atypically" - causing all
    kinds of problems which it shouldn't normally do. It's those problems that make
    me too weak to survive any treatment designed to kill the cancer cells. That includes
    both established therapeutics and the latest things like Car-T (which is still
    in early stages for solid tumours anyway), and also any new targetted drugs. Anything
    that works will cause a lot of cell death amongst the cancer cells (and, in most
    cases, collateral damage in healthy cells), and the cell debris and inflammation
    would kill me in my current state.

    lymph nodes pressing on stuff they're not supposed to.  I could go for the whole
    cyborg business, but eventually this f*****r will throw a few metastases at my
    brain, which I don't fancy delegating to machinery.

    it's an easy synthesis from a cheapish precursor. Just hoping they can do it within

    chemo only works for a few months or a year; then the cancer cells adapt by making
    more glutathione, which protects them against the chemotherapy agent. But APR-246
    screws up glutathione. So, you can restore chemo-sensitivity to chemo-resistant
    tumours.  '

  note: "\t[reensure] --\tI've been mulling over the small molecule approach, and\
    \ am stuck on codon fooling. A 9 aa peptide most surely qualifies, but the only\
    \ use my limited exposure to the science allows is to create a 3:70 tRNA acceptor\
    \ stem modifiction to substitute Arginine (R) for Histidine (H) in the subject\
    \ protein read from mRNA. That might mean *all* Histidines in subject peptides\
    \ in a patient's body would be switched to Arginine. Such a flood of missense\
    \ peptide could deplete a patient's enzyme pool as well as switching apoptosis\
    \ to active. For cancerous cells that would be great, but for healthy tissue that\
    \ would be a deleterious side effect -- a lot of anion holes would be plugged.\
    \  Granted, there is an effect of regulation caused by peptides in association\
    \ with tRNA that modifies ribosomes so that A<B<C<D when aa (any letter) sequences\
    \ are read as primers when synthetase lays out codonA<codonB<condonC<codonD, and\
    \ a peptide bound properly to the acceptor stem of tRNA(H) to convert it to tRNA(R)\
    \ might be best constructed so that the peptide matches not only the tRNA(3:70)\
    \ aa sequence but also the leading and lagging aa sequence of the desired p53\
    \ translation.  There are layers of proofreading built into normal cells that\
    \ may or may not (hopefully) exist in cancerous cells.  Other factors to consider\
    \ as well, such as can tRNA(3:70)(R<H) be created and administered in vivo, or\
    \ can a small molecule be smuggled into cells and targeted to the synthetase system\
    \ for acylating tRNA.  More to think about, obviously.\n"

  content: '[reensure] I''ve been mulling over the small molecule approach, and am
    stuck on codon fooling. A 9 aa peptide most surely qualifies, but the only use
    my limited exposure to the science allows is to create a 3:70 tRNA acceptor stem
    modifiction to substitute Arginine (R) for Histidine (H) in the subject protein
    read from mRNA. That might mean *all* Histidines in subject peptides in a patient''s
    body would be switched to Arginine. Such a flood of missense peptide could deplete
    a patient''s enzyme pool as well as switching apoptosis to active. For cancerous
    cells that would be great, but for healthy tissue that would be a deleterious
    side effect -- a lot of anion holes would be plugged.  Granted, there is an effect
    of regulation caused by peptides in association with tRNA that modifies ribosomes
    so that A<B<C<D when aa (any letter) sequences are read as primers when synthetase
    lays out codonA<codonB<condonC<codonD, and a peptide bound properly to the acceptor
    stem of tRNA(H) to convert it to tRNA(R) might be best constructed so that the
    peptide matches not only the tRNA(3:70) aa sequence but also the leading and lagging
    aa sequence of the desired p53 translation.  There are layers of proofreading
    built into normal cells that may or may not (hopefully) exist in cancerous cells.  Other
    factors to consider as well, such as can tRNA(3:70)(R<H) be created and administered
    in vivo, or can a small molecule be smuggled into cells and targeted to the synthetase
    system for acylating tRNA.  More to think about, obviously.'
